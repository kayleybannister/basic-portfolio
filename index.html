        <p class="aboutMeP">Hello everyone! My name is Kayley Bannister. I was born in Savannah, GA but raised in a small town called Lincolnton, GA. It was very small, one school and only three red lights.</p>
        <p class="aboutMeP">I graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2013 with a Bachelors of Business Administration in Information Systems with a minor in Management.</p>
        <p class="aboutMeP">After graduating, I moved to Savannah to work for a freight forwarder as an ocean export documentation specialist. There was never a dull moment working for them, but I have always wanted to have a career in a field that was closer to my major in school. I am very excited about my future in Web Development.</p>
